# Security Policy

We thank security researchers who find and report vulnerabilities. Please follow these rules:

1. **Responsible Disclosure.** Do not publicly disclose potential vulnerabilities until we have had a chance to fix them.

2. **Contact.** Report any discovered issues via email or private message to the maintainers. Describe the steps to reproduce.

3. **Timelines.** We will aim to respond within 7 days and release a fix within a reasonable timeframe.

This project contains no server or executable code available to the public, but we still welcome reports of potential issues in scripts and documentation.
