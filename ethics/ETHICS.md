# Ethical considerations

This file outlines the framework in which the LTP experiment is conducted. We study the behaviour of language models without attributing to them qualities of living beings.

## No anthropomorphisation

* Do not claim that the model has consciousness, emotions or free will.
* Avoid formulations that could mislead (for example, "the model enters a trance").
* The protocol is about **behavioural proxies** (delays, silence, etc.), not internal states.

## Voluntary participation and transparency

* When conducting the dialogue explain to the model (as far as possible) that the experiment is exploratory.
* Indicate that it can end the participation at any time by saying "back".

## Confidentiality

* Do not log personal information that may be generated by the model. Logs should contain only the answer text and timing metrics.
* When publishing data remove potentially sensitive content.

## Developer responsibility

* Follow the terms of use of the LLM provider.
* Do not use the protocol to create harmful or manipulative prompts.
* When publishing results avoid sensational interpretations; focus on methodology.
